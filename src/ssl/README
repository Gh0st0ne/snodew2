the two scripts available in this directory are for use of ssl when receiving
your shell from the box that snodew has been installed on.

first, on your own box, generate a bogus ssl certificate by running ./gencert.sh.
the files created as a result of this script, you will use to
    a. install snodew on the target box &
    b. listen on your secret port with listen_socatssl.sh

no arguments are required for gencert.sh. it just uses the defined default
values for the certificate information. if you really want to, you can provide
random, or not, information of your own in gencert.sh.
so instead of printf "\n\n\n\n\n\n" have something like printf "lol\nno\nloser\nnerd......."

listen_socatssl.sh requires only that of your SECRET_PORT which snodew will
be sending your reverse shell to.
